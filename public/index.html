                    This past summer, I was an REU intern for USC at the Institute for Creative Technology, where my goal was 
                    to create a labeled repository for machine learning models that track human-to-human social engagement. I am 
                    also currently employed at CALSys Labs as a research assistant, where my primary responsibilities include 
                    searching and creating proprietary methods for breaking CAPTCHAS. These breakers will then be integrated into 
                    existing web crawlers to assist in dark web exploitation. On top of my recent endeavors, I was also the student 
                    chief engineer of ground communication systems for the Northrop Grumman Collaboration Project, where my team 
                    was to establish a centralized command and control center’s digital infrastructure to maintain a communication 
                    link between multiple unmanned vehicles.</p>

                    I took my first Computer Science class. The rigor of a Computer Science degree is not something one should tackle on 
                    their own and being in a commuter school, it’s easy to feel very lost and alone. As the Events and Outreach Chair,
